What to improve:
    ☐ Look into how to get newlines to always fit what is written above
        Currently in my neovim config at least, if i go to a category (eg line 1 this file)
        and press "o" the cursor will be set to col 0 instead of being indented once
    ☐ Look into "de-denting"
    ☐ Take another look at adding support for @done(timestamp), @started(timestamp) and @cancelled(timestamp)
